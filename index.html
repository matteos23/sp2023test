  <i><h1>My favourite sports to play as well as well as what I like about Chicago and my favorite foods </h1></i>
       <i><h3> My favorite sports to play are basketball and football because my dad introduced football to me at an early age and we bonded over it and basketball I started playing with my brother at an early age </h3></i>
      <i><h3> I love Chicago because I was born there and my dad migrated from Ethiopia to there in 1985. I felt a sense of connection to the people in Chicago and was very sad when we were forced to leave</h3></i>
       <i><h3> My favorite foods are injera which is an indigenous food native to Ethiopia which we use in almost every food and eggs because it is easy to make and very delicous.</h3></i>
